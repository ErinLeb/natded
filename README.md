## Description

This Coq development is an attempt to formalize as directly as possible a typical logic course about 1st-order predicate calculus using the Natural Deduction style. We followed here a [logic course](http://www.irif.fr/~letouzey/preuves/cours.pdf) (in French) due to Alexandre Miquel. Showing parts of this Coq development to Master students (at least the definitions and proof statements and proof sketchs) is now an teaching alternative instead of using the original course pdf, or in complement of it.

Natural Deduction and some of its meta-theory have been formalized (such as a subsitution lemma), including classical models (seen as Coq types + functions + propositions), and the completeness theorem (following the Henkin approach).

Trying to be faithful to the original document, formulas are first encoded using names (i.e. strings) in quantifiers. As expected, this triggers difficulties (name capture) during substitutions, and leads to the use of alpha-equivalence. Then another encoding is proposed (locally nameless) which is immune to these issues, while avoiding most of the technicalities of the approach of De Bruijn indices. A two-way conversion between these named and locally-nameless encodings is provided and proved correct. The rest of the meta-theorical study is performed on the locally-nameless representation.
